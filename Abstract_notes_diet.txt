*Diet and Sclerosis*


Bock et al (2018) - Ketogenic diets attenuate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase gene expression in multiple 
sclerosis
- pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis since they 
augment vascular permeability and induce leukocyte migration into the brain
- ketogenic diets can reduce the expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory 
eicosanoids. Pharmacologial interference with eicosanoid biosynthesis might consitute a strategy 
supplementing current therapeutic approches for MS

Choi et al (2016) - Diet mimicking fasting promotes regeneration and reduces autoimmunity and multiple sclerosis
symptoms
- Periodic 3 day cycles of a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) are effective in ameliorating dymyelination
and symptoms in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model
- the FMD reduced clinical severity in all mice, and completely reveresed symptoms in 20% of the animals.
- The FMD promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration and remyelination in axons in response to both
EAE and cuprizone MS models, supporting its effects on both suppression of autoimmunity and remyelination.
- FMD or chronic ketogenic diets are safe, feasible, and potentially effective in the treatment of relapsing
 remitting multiple sclerosis patients

Field et al (2018) - Conventional and quantitative MRI in a novel feline model of demyelination and endogenous
remyelination
- Study concerned 10 adult cats at various stages of demyelination induced by an irradiated diet
- Assessment was done via MRI of the brain, optic nerves, and cervical spinal cord; a subset of diseased cats
was euthanized for comparative histopathology

Ghaiad et al (2016) - Resveratrol promotes remyelination in cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis: biochemical 
and histological study
- Resveratrol is a stilbenoid polyphenol, known to pass blood brain barrier and exhibit antioxidant, anti-
inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in several brain injuries
- Ex vivo measures included measurement of brain content of glutahione, lipid peroxidation products, adenosine
triphosphate, and phospho-inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor kB-a. The gene expression of myelin basic protein,
2',3''-cyclic nucleotide 3'phosphodiesterase, oligodendrocyte transcription factor-1 (Olig1), NF-kB p65 subunit,
and tumour necrosis factor-a was also estimated. Luxol fast blue/periodc acid-Schiff stained brain sections were
blindly scored to asses the myelin status
- Resveratrol effectively enhanced motor coordination and balance, reverse curpizone-induced demyelination, improved
mitochondrial function, alleviated oxidative stress, and inhibited NF-kB signalling
- Interestingly, resveratrol incrased Olig1 expression that is positively correlated to active remyelination

Klepper et al - GLUT1 Deficiency with delated myelination respnoding to ketogenic diet
- In a clinical example of a boy with delayed myelination, six month of a ketogenic diet resulted in an improved 
high subcortical white matter signal
- Delayed subcortical myelination may occur in GLUT1 deficiency syndrome as a nonspecific finding reflecting 
development delay
- In patients without seizures, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy may prove 
useful tools to monitor th response to a ketogenic diet

Klosinski et al (2015) - White matter lipids as a ketogenic fuel supply in aging female brain'implicaionts for 
Alzheimer's disease
- This study investigeated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide 
production and cytosolid-phsopholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain ageing
- An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in 
brain detone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies
- The catabolism of myeline lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response 
to address brain fuel and energy demand

Liskiewicz et al (2016) - Sciatic nerve regeneration in rats subjected to ketogenic diet
- Fifty one rats were divided in to three experimental grups and one control group. Their right sciatic nerve was 
crished and the animals were kept on either a standard or ketogenic diet
- Functional catwalk tests showed no difference between the groups
- Morphometic evaluation showed most similarities to the healthy (uncrushed) nerves in the ketogenic groups; with 
the nerves in the ST group differing mostly from all other grups
- Regeneration of sciatic nerves was improved in ketogenic-preconditioned rats. These results suggest a 
neuroprotective effect of KD on peripheral nerves.

Veyrat-Derebex et al (2018) - How can a ketogenic diet improve motor function?
- A ketogenic diet increases ketone body production and their concentraiton in the blood, providing the brain an 
alternative energy supply that enhances oxidative mitochondrial metabolism
- In addition to its profound impact on neuro-metabolism and bioenergetics, the neuroprotective effect of 
specific polyuynsaturated fatty acids and KBs involves pleiotropic mechanisms, such as the modulation of neuronal 
membrane excitability, inflammation, or reative oxygen species production
- Motor function has also been shown to be improved by ketone diets and/or medium-chain triglyceride diets in 
rodent models of Alheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, anyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury
- these studies have proposed that ketone diets may induce a modification in synaptic morphology and function, 
involving ionic channels, glutaminergic transmission, or synaptic vesicular cycling machinery

Yand & Fan (2017) - Diets for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: pay attention to nutritional 
intervention
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterised by the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons
- Typic features of ALS are limb paralysis, muscle atrophy, dysphagia, dysarthria, shortness of breath, and 
respiratory failure
- There is a potential linear relationship in ALS between serum lactate and motor deterioration and that slower 
lactate elimination rate might be assoicated with faster disease progression
- Several studies have reported that nutritional status is losely related to the survival time of ALS patients, 
and there exists a U-shaped association between patients' body bass index (BMI) and mortality.

Armon-Omer et al (2019) - New insights on the nutrition status and antioxidant capacity in multiple sclerosis 
patients
- 63 MS patients and 83 healthy controls were given a dietary questionnaire, blood tests, quantification of cell 
membrane fatty acids, and serum antioxidant capacity to determine nutritional status.
- MS patients consumed a more limited diet compared with the healthy group, indicated by a lower average of 31 
nutrients and by consumption levels of zinc and thiamine below the recommended daily intake.
- Both consumption and measured iron values were significantly lower in MS patients, with the lowest measures in 
the severe MS group
- Long saturated fatty acids (>C16) were significantly lower in MS patients, while palmitic and palmitoleic acids 
wer both higher
- Serum total antioxidant capacity was significantly lower in the MS group compared with healthy controls, with 
the lowest measures in patients with severe MS
- This study points to the possible correlation between nutritional status and MS

Beckett et al (2019) - Diet and multiple sclerosis: scoping review of web-based recommendatiosn
- There is currently no scientific evidence supporting the use of specific diets in the management of multiple 
sclerosis (MS); the strongest dietary associations are observed with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid 
supplementation
- The most common dietary pattern advised on these webpages was the low-fat, high-fiber balanced diet, followed 
by the low-saturated fat diet, near-vegetarian Swank diet, and the Paleo diet

Bisht et al (2014) - A multimodal intervention for patients with secondary progressive ultiple sclerosis 
feasibility and effect on fatigue
- A multimodal intervention including a modifed paleolithic diet with supplements, stretching, strengthening 
exercises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, meditation, and massage was used
- There was a significant improvement in fatigue im those who completed the study

Bisht et al (2017) - Effects of a multimodal intervention on gait and balance of subjects with progressive 
multiple sclerosis: a prospective longitudinal pilot study
- Multimodal intervention including a modified paleolithic diet, nutritional supplements, stretching, 
strenghening exervises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, meditation, and massage on 
walking performance and balance of subjects with progressive multiple sclerosis
- A multimodal lifestyle intervention may improve walking performance and balance in subjects with progressive MS 
who have mild0-to-moderate gait impairment, whereas subjects with severe gait impairments may not respond to this 
intervention

Bisht et al (2015) - Multimodal intervention improves fatigue and quality of life in subjects with progressive 
multple scerosis: a pilot study
- fatigue is a disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis and reduces quality of life
- Multimodal intervention, including a modified Paleolithic diet, nutritional supplements, stretching, 
strengthening exercises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, and stress management on 
perceived fatigue and quality of life of persons with progressive MS
- subjects showed good adherence with this intervention and did not report any seriouys side effects
- High responders undertook longer duration of maassage and stretches per puscle in 12 months
- Multimodal intervention may reduce fatigue and improve quality of life of subjects with progressive MS

Black et al (2019) - Higher non-processed red meat consumption is associated with reduced risk of central nervous 
sytem demyelineation
- Using a food frequency questionnaire data set from the 2003-2006 Ausimmune study, an indiced,t matched, 
case-controlled study examining environmental risk factors for nervous system demyelination
- Non-processed and processed meat density was calculated and correlation analysis was done with adjustment 
according to history of infectious mononucleosis, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, smoking, race, 
education, body mass index, and dietary misreporting
- A one standard deviation increase in non-processed red meat density was associated with a 19% reduced risk of 
central nervous system demyelination
- There was no statistically significant association between non-processed red meat density and risk of central 
nervous system demyelination in males, while there was an associated 26% reduced risk in females

Bromley et al (2019) - Impact of nutritional intake on function in people with mild-to-moderate multiple 
sclerosis
- Cross-sectional pilot study included 20 ambulatory adult volunteers with MS
- Significant correlations were seen between the percentage of diet comprising fats and the 6-minute walk test 
and the physical functionig component of the 36-item short form heealth survey
- the percentage of carbohydrates was significantly correlated with the 6 minute walk test, daily activity, and 
the physical functioning component of the 36 item short form health survey.
- Cholesterol, folate, iron, and magnesium were significantly positively correlated with the physical functioning 
component of the 36-item short form health survey, and the 6 minute walk test
- These findings indicate better ambulation, daily function, and QOL with increased fat intae, decreased 
carbohydrate intake, and increased intake of the micronutrients cholesterol, folate, iron, and magnesium in 
people with mild-to-moderate MS

Chenard et al (2019) - Nutrient composition comparison between a modified paleolithic diet for multiple sclerosis 
and the recommended healthy US-style eating pattern
- Roy Swank proposed a low saturated fat diet to treat MS around 1950 and showed delayed disease progression in 
his patients. There is insufficient evidnce to recomment this diet for MS and default dietary recommentations are 
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)Swank recommended dietary supplements corrected menu shortfalls in 
vitamin D, E, calcium, folate, and iron but not dietary fiber, potassium and choline
- Nutritional adequancy of the Swank modeled diet was similar to healthy US-style eating pattern for 17 vitamins 
and minerals with similar shortfall nutrients except magnesium and dietary fibre
- Swank menus have similar nutritional adequacy as healthy US-style eating pattern.
- Inclusion of foods high in dietary fiber, potassium and choline may be advised as well as selection of foods to 
reduce sodium below the tolerable upper intake level

Coe et al (2018) - A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled feasibility trial of flavonoid-rich cocoa for 
fatigue in people with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis
- During a 60week intervention, participants consumed a high or low flavonoid cocoa beverage daily. Fatigue and 
fatigabilty were measured at three visits (1,3,& 6 week)
- 40 people with MS were randomized to high or low flavonoid groups
- There was a small effect on fatigue and a moderate efect of fatigability
- There were seven adverse events (?), only one of which was possibly related and it was resolved

Ganesh & Stahnisch (2013) - On the historical succession of vessel-based therapies in the treatment of multiple 
sclerosis
- CCSVI model of MS, and th eassociated surgical 'venoplasty'interventions have often been advertised as a novel 
idea
- In the 1930s, Tracy Jackson Putnam attempted pharmocological anticoagulation
- In the 1940s, Richard M. Brickner's studyies of vasodilatory drugs, which futher inspired trials of 
sympathectomy and ganglionectomy
- In the 1950s, Ilya Mark Scheinker studied vasopressor therapy, while Roy Laver Swank intestigated the effects 
of a low saturated fat diet in his patients

Irish et al (2017) - Randomized control trial evaluation of a modified Paleolithic dietary intervention in the 
treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a pilot study
- The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate a modified Paleolithic dietary intervention in the treatment of 
fatigue and other symptoms in relapsing-remitting MS
- A Paleolithic diet may be useful in the treatment and management of MS, by reducing perceived fatigue, 
increasing mental and physical quality of life, increasing exercise capacity, and improving hand and leg 
function.
- By increasing vitamin K serum levels, the modified Paleolithic diet may also reduce inflammation

Jakamovski et al (2019) - Dietary and lifestyle factors in multple sclerosis progression: results from a 5-year 
longitudinal MRI study
- To assess the effect of lifestyle-based risk factors linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) on clinical and 
MRI-derived outcomes
- Lifestyle risk factors contribute to accelerated centrail brain atrophy in MS patients, whereas unhealthier 
diet is associated with MS lesion accrual.
- Despite the lower overall effect when compared to sex-matched healthy controls, lifestyle-based modifications 
may still provide a beneficial effect on reducing brain atrophy in MS patients

Lee et al (2017) - A multimodal, nonpharmacologic intervention improves mood and cognitive function ni people 
with multiple sclerosis
- The objective of this study was to examine whether participation in a 12-month multimodal intervention would 
improve mood and cognitive function in adults with progressive multiple sclerosis
- In this one-arm open-label feasibility trial, participants were prescribed a home-based multimodal 
intervention, including a modified Paleolithic diet; an exercise program (stretching and strengthening of the 
trunk and lower limb muscles); neuromuascular electical stimualtion of trunk and lower limb muscles, and stress 
management (meditation and self-massage)
- The more individuals participated in the intervention activities, the greater improvements they had from 
baseline to 12 months on self-report measures of anxiety
- Mood and cognitive improvements were more closely related to a higher intake of modified Paleolithic 
diet tahn to exercise and stress management dosage.
- Anxiety and depression changes were evident after just a few months, whereas changes in cognitive 
function were generally not observed until later in the intervention perid
- Mood and cognitive function changes from baseline to 12 months were significantly associated with fatigue 
improvements
- A modified, Paleolithic diet, exercise, EStim, and stess management intervention like this one has the 
potential to improve th emood and cognitive symptoms that can lead to considerable suffering in people with 
Ms, potentially improving the quality of life and function for people with progressive MS

Masullo et al (2014) - Complementary and alternative medicine use and nutrient intake among individuals 
with Multiple Sclerosis in the United States
- The aim of this pilot study was to determine the prevalence of specific types of complementary and 
alternative medicienes used by adults with MS in the United States
- This study found that a majority of the sample population used complementary and alternative medicines 
within the previous 12 months, the most prevalent type being vitamins/minerals, nonvitamin, nonmineralm 
natural products, relaxation techniques, and special diets
- Subjects following the Paleo diet did not meet the estimated average requirement for vitamins D and E, 
while those on the Swank diet were below the estimated average requirement for vitamins C, A, E and folate
Inadequate intakes of certain vitamins and minerals by those following the Swank and Paleo diet suggest 
these diets may be too restrictive, thus futher research is warranted

Mische & Mowry (2018) - The evidence for dietary intervntions and nutritional supplements as treatment 
options in multiple sclerosis: a review
- This review aims to critically evaluate published studies examining diets and nutritional supplements for 
the impact on prevention and prognosis of multiple sclerosis
- There is a negative relationship between the Mediterranean diet and vascular disease, and vascular 
co-morbidities are associated with a worse MS prognosis
- Low-fat, fish-based diets and sodium-resticted ddets, calorie restriction, the paleo diet, and 
gluten-free diets have been examined, mostly in observational studies; results are inconvlusive
- Pilot data shows a posssible benefit of biotin with respect to disability worsening in people and 
progressive MS
- Many other nutritional supplements have been tested, including several anti-oxidants. While some early 
studies show positive resluts, no results has been definitive
- Higher quality clinical trials are needed to ascertain the possible benefits of nutritional supplements

Pommerich et al (2018) - Is there an effect of dietary intake on MS-related fatigue? - A systematic 
literature review
- Fatigue is considered the most common symptom of persons with multiple sclerosis, occurring in up to 90% 
of the patients at some point with two-thirds of persons with MS experience fatigue as their most 
disturbing symptom
- Pharmacological treatment options for MS-related fatigue show only limited and contradicting results
- A considerable interest in dietary interventions as a means of MS symptom managment has advanced in the 
MS community
- Few empirical sutdies focussing on the effect of holistic dietary intakeon fatigue has not been 
systemically examined
- Dietary intake holds the potential to lower MS-related fatigue, but sdolid conclusions are not possible 
based on the existing evidence
- Sparce evidence points toward an effect of adequate magniesiuma and folate intake and a trent for 
decreased fatigue

Sand (2018) - The role of diet in multiple sclerosis: mechanistic connections and current evidence
- Current evidence for the effects of fatty acid, fruits, and vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and salt are 
reviewed
- Dietary patterns including overall diety quality, caloric restriction, McDougall diet, Paleolithic diet, 
and Mediterranean diet are discussed
- Several individual dietary components and patterns demonstrate potential for significant impact in MS. 
Definitive answers regarding the ability of diet to act as a disease modifier in MS will ultimately require 
large-scale clinical trials

Swank (1991) - Multiple sclerosis: fat-oil relationship
- Between 1949 and 1984, 150 patients with multiple sclerosis consumed low-fat diets
- Fat, oil, and protein intakes; disability; and deaths were determined
- A daily intake of fat lower than 20.1 g/day (avg 17 g/day), 31% died, and average deterioration was 
slight
- A daily intake greater than 20 g/day (avg 25 or 41 g/day) was attended by serious disability and the 
deaths of 79 and 81% respectively
- Oil intake bore an indirect relationship to fat consumption
- Minimally disabled patients who followed diet recommendations deteriorated little if at all, and only 
5% failed to survive the 34 year of the study, whereas 80% who failed to follow diet recommendations did 
not survive the study period
- High sensitivity to fats suggests that saturated animal fats are directly involved in the genesis of 
multiple sclerosis

Swank & Dugan (1990) - Effect of low saturated fat diet in early and late cases of multiple sclerosis
- For patients with minimun, moderate, and severe neurological disability, those who adhered to the 
prescribed diet (=< 20g fat/day) showed significantly less deteriorationa nd much lower death rates than 
did those who consumed more fat than prescribed (>20 g fat/day)
- This study, as above, occurred over 34 years
- The greatest benefit was seen in those with minimum disability at the start of the trial; in this group, 
when those who diet from non-MS diseases were excluded from the analyis, 95% survived and remained 
physically active

Swank & Grimsgaard (1988) - Multiple sclerosis: the lipid relationship
- Betweeen 1949 and 1984, 150 multiple sclerosis patients consumed low-fat diets
- On daily fat consumption of less than 20.1 g (average 17 g), 31% died and deterioration was slight
- Dialy intakes of greater than 20 g (average of either 25 or 41g) were attended by serious disability and 
deaths of 79% and 81% respectively

Swank et al (1983) - Cerebral blood flow and red cell delivery in normal subjects and in multiple 
sclerosis
- Regional cerebral blood flow was determined in 77 normal females and 53 normal males 
of different ages and in 26 men and 45 women with multiple scleoris by the inhalation of radioactive Xe133 
method.
- In the normal subjects, the CBF was relatively high in the ttens and fell, at first rapidly and 
then slowly in both sexes with age. During adult life, the flow in females was significantly higher than in 
males.
- The delivery in packed red cells was nearly the same for both sexes
- In patients with MS, there occurred a progressive generalized decrease in CBF and in packed red cell 
delivery with age which was significantly greater than observed in normal subjects
- The rate of decrease in CBF and red cell delivery correlated directly with the rate and progress of the 
disease

Vasconcelos et al (2019) - Nrf2/ARE pathway modulatio by dietary energy regulation in neurological 
disorders
- Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related facotr 2 (Nrf2) regulates the expression of an array of enzymes with 
important detoxifying and antioxidant functions
- Current findings support the role of high levels of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of neurological 
disorders
- Given the central role played by Nrf2 in counteracting oxidative damage, a number of studies have 
targeted the modulation of this transcription factor in order to confer neuroprotection
- Nrf2 activity is tightly regulated by oxidative stress and energy-based stimuli. Thus, many dietary 
interventios based on energy intake regulation, such as dietary energy restriction or high-fat diet, 
modulate Nrf2 with consequences for a variety of cellular processes that affect brain health
- Dietary energy restriction, by either restricting calorie intake or meal frequency, activates Nrf2 
thereby triggering its protective effects, whilst high fat diets inhibit this pathway, thereby exacerbating 
oxidative 
stress
- Consequently, dietary energy restriction protocols can be valuable strategies in the management of 
central nervous system disorders

Wahls et al (2018) - Dietary approaches to treat MS-related fatigue: comparing the modified Paleolithic 
(Wahls elimination) and low saturated fat (Swank) diets on perceived fatigue in persons with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial
- Currently available interventions have had limited success in relieving MS-related fatigute
- Clinically significant reductions in perceived fatigue severity have been reporetd in a multimodal 
intervention pilot study that included a Paleolithic diet in addition to stress reduction, exercise, and 
electrical muscle stimulation
- The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a modified Paleolithic and low saturated fat 
diet on perceived fatigue, cognitive and motor symptoms, and quality of life in persons with 
relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
- Because fatiue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms of MS, effective management and reduction 
of MS-related fatigue has the potential to increase quality of life in this population

Wahls et al (2019) - Review of two populat eating plants within the multiple sclerosis community: low 
saturated fat and modified paleolithic
- Diet choices are modifiable environmental factors that may influence MS disease activity
- Dr. Swank theorized restriction of saturated fat would reduce vascular dysfunction in the central nervous 
system
- Dr. Wahls initially theorized that detailed guidance to increase intake oif specifi foodstuffs would 
facilitate incrased intake of nutrients key to neuronal health. Dr. Wahls further theorized restriction of 
lectins would reduce intestinal permeability and CNS inflammation
- The purpose of this paper is to review the published research of the low saturated fat (Swank) and the 
modified Paleolithic dietsand the rationale for the structure of the Swank diet and low lectin version of 
the Wahls diet being investigated in the clinical trial
