Bock et al - Ketogenic diets attenuate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase gene expression in multiple 
sclerosis
- pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis since they 
augment vascular permeability and induce leukocyte migration into the brain
- ketogenic diets can reduce the expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory 
eicosanoids. Pharmacologial interference with eicosanoid biosynthesis might consitute a strategy 
supplementing current therapeutic approches for MS

Choi et al - Diet mimicking fasting promotes regeneration and reduces autoimmunity and multiple sclerosis
symptoms
- Periodic 3 day cycles of a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) are effective in ameliorating dymyelination
and symptoms in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model
- the FMD reduced clinical severity in all mice, and completely reveresed symptoms in 20% of the animals.
- The FMD promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration and remyelination in axons in response to both
EAE and cuprizone MS models, supporting its effects on both suppression of autoimmunity and remyelination.
- FMD or chronic ketogenic diets are safe, feasible, and potentially effective in the treatment of relapsing
 remitting multiple sclerosis patients

Field et al - Conventional and quantitative MRI in a novel feline model of demyelination and endogenous
remyelination
- Study concerned 10 adult cats at various stages of demyelination induced by an irradiated diet
- Assessment was done via MRI of the brain, optic nerves, and cervical spinal cord; a subset of diseased cats
was euthanized for comparative histopathology

Ghaiad et al - Resveratrol promotes remyelination in cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis: biochemical and 
histological study
- Resveratrol is a stilbenoid polyphenol, known to pass blood brain barrier and exhibit antioxidant, anti-
inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in several brain injuries
- Ex vivo measures included measurement of brain content of glutahione, lipid peroxidation products, adenosine
triphosphate, and phospho-inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor kB-a. The gene expression of myelin basic protein,
2',3''-cyclic nucleotide 3'phosphodiesterase, oligodendrocyte transcription factor-1 (Olig1), NF-kB p65 subunit,
and tumour necrosis factor-a was also estimated. Luxol fast blue/periodc acid-Schiff stained brain sections were
blindly scored to asses the myelin status
- Resveratrol effectively enhanced motor coordination and balance, reverse curpizone-induced demyelination, improved
mitochondrial function, alleviated oxidative stress, and inhibited NF-kB signalling
- Interestingly, resveratrol incrased Olig1 expression that is positively correlated to active remyelination

Klepper et al - GLUT1 Deficiency with delated myelination respnoding to ketogenic diet
- In a clinical example of a boy with delayed myelination, six month of a ketogenic diet resulted in an improved 
high subcortical white matter signal
- Delayed subcortical myelination may occur in GLUT1 deficiency syndrome as a nonspecific finding reflecting 
development delay
- In patients without seizures, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy may prove 
useful tools to monitor th response to a ketogenic diet

Klosinski et al - White matter lipids as a ketogenic fuel supply in aging female brain'implicaionts for 
Alzheimer's disease
- This study investigeated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide 
production and cytosolid-phsopholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain ageing
- An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in 
brain detone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies
- The catabolism of myeline lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response 
to address brain fuel and energy demand

Liskiewicz et al - Sciatic nerve regeneration in rats subjected to ketogenic diet
- Fifty one rats were divided in to three experimental grups and one control group. Their right sciatic nerve was 
crished and the animals were kept on either a standard or ketogenic diet
- Functional catwalk tests showed no difference between the groups
- Morphometic evaluation showed most similarities to the healthy (uncrushed) nerves in the ketogenic groups; with 
the nerves in the ST group differing mostly from all other grups
- Regeneration of sciatic nerves was improved in ketogenic-preconditioned rats. These results suggest a 
neuroprotective effect of KD on peripheral nerves.

Veyrat-Derebex et al - How can a ketogenic diet improve motor function?
- A ketogenic diet increases ketone body production and their concentraiton in the blood, providing the brain an 
alternative energy supply that enhances oxidative mitochondrial metabolism
- In addition to its profound impact on neuro-metabolism and bioenergetics, the neuroprotective effect of 
specific polyuynsaturated fatty acids and KBs involves pleiotropic mechanisms, such as the modulation of neuronal 
membrane excitability, inflammation, or reative oxygen species production
