Bock et al (2018) - Ketogenic diets attenuate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase gene expression in multiple 
sclerosis
- pro-inflammatory eicosanoids have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis since they 
augment vascular permeability and induce leukocyte migration into the brain
- ketogenic diets can reduce the expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory 
eicosanoids. Pharmacologial interference with eicosanoid biosynthesis might consitute a strategy 
supplementing current therapeutic approches for MS

Choi et al (2016) - Diet mimicking fasting promotes regeneration and reduces autoimmunity and multiple sclerosis
symptoms
- Periodic 3 day cycles of a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) are effective in ameliorating dymyelination
and symptoms in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model
- the FMD reduced clinical severity in all mice, and completely reveresed symptoms in 20% of the animals.
- The FMD promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration and remyelination in axons in response to both
EAE and cuprizone MS models, supporting its effects on both suppression of autoimmunity and remyelination.
- FMD or chronic ketogenic diets are safe, feasible, and potentially effective in the treatment of relapsing
 remitting multiple sclerosis patients

Field et al (2018) - Conventional and quantitative MRI in a novel feline model of demyelination and endogenous
remyelination
- Study concerned 10 adult cats at various stages of demyelination induced by an irradiated diet
- Assessment was done via MRI of the brain, optic nerves, and cervical spinal cord; a subset of diseased cats
was euthanized for comparative histopathology

Ghaiad et al (2016) - Resveratrol promotes remyelination in cuprizone model of multiple sclerosis: biochemical 
and histological study
- Resveratrol is a stilbenoid polyphenol, known to pass blood brain barrier and exhibit antioxidant, anti-
inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects in several brain injuries
- Ex vivo measures included measurement of brain content of glutahione, lipid peroxidation products, adenosine
triphosphate, and phospho-inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor kB-a. The gene expression of myelin basic protein,
2',3''-cyclic nucleotide 3'phosphodiesterase, oligodendrocyte transcription factor-1 (Olig1), NF-kB p65 subunit,
and tumour necrosis factor-a was also estimated. Luxol fast blue/periodc acid-Schiff stained brain sections were
blindly scored to asses the myelin status
- Resveratrol effectively enhanced motor coordination and balance, reverse curpizone-induced demyelination, improved
mitochondrial function, alleviated oxidative stress, and inhibited NF-kB signalling
- Interestingly, resveratrol incrased Olig1 expression that is positively correlated to active remyelination

Klepper et al - GLUT1 Deficiency with delated myelination respnoding to ketogenic diet
- In a clinical example of a boy with delayed myelination, six month of a ketogenic diet resulted in an improved 
high subcortical white matter signal
- Delayed subcortical myelination may occur in GLUT1 deficiency syndrome as a nonspecific finding reflecting 
development delay
- In patients without seizures, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy may prove 
useful tools to monitor th response to a ketogenic diet

Klosinski et al (2015) - White matter lipids as a ketogenic fuel supply in aging female brain'implicaionts for 
Alzheimer's disease
- This study investigeated decline in mitochondrial respiration, increased mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide 
production and cytosolid-phsopholipase-A2 sphingomyelinase pathway activation during female brain ageing
- An increase in fatty acids and mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism machinery was coincident with a rise in 
brain detone bodies and decline in plasma ketone bodies
- The catabolism of myeline lipids to generate ketone bodies can be viewed as a systems level adaptive response 
to address brain fuel and energy demand

Liskiewicz et al (2016) - Sciatic nerve regeneration in rats subjected to ketogenic diet
- Fifty one rats were divided in to three experimental grups and one control group. Their right sciatic nerve was 
crished and the animals were kept on either a standard or ketogenic diet
- Functional catwalk tests showed no difference between the groups
- Morphometic evaluation showed most similarities to the healthy (uncrushed) nerves in the ketogenic groups; with 
the nerves in the ST group differing mostly from all other grups
- Regeneration of sciatic nerves was improved in ketogenic-preconditioned rats. These results suggest a 
neuroprotective effect of KD on peripheral nerves.

Veyrat-Derebex et al (2018) - How can a ketogenic diet improve motor function?
- A ketogenic diet increases ketone body production and their concentraiton in the blood, providing the brain an 
alternative energy supply that enhances oxidative mitochondrial metabolism
- In addition to its profound impact on neuro-metabolism and bioenergetics, the neuroprotective effect of 
specific polyuynsaturated fatty acids and KBs involves pleiotropic mechanisms, such as the modulation of neuronal 
membrane excitability, inflammation, or reative oxygen species production
- Motor function has also been shown to be improved by ketone diets and/or medium-chain triglyceride diets in 
rodent models of Alheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, anyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury
- these studies have proposed that ketone diets may induce a modification in synaptic morphology and function, 
involving ionic channels, glutaminergic transmission, or synaptic vesicular cycling machinery

Yand & Fan (2017) - Diets for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: pay attention to nutritional 
intervention
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterised by the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons
- Typic features of ALS are limb paralysis, muscle atrophy, dysphagia, dysarthria, shortness of breath, and 
respiratory failure
- There is a potential linear relationship in ALS between serum lactate and motor deterioration and that slower 
lactate elimination rate might be assoicated with faster disease progression
- Several studies have reported that nutritional status is losely related to the survival time of ALS patients, 
and there exists a U-shaped association between patients' body bass index (BMI) and mortality.

Armon-Omer et al (2019) - New insights on the nutrition status and antioxidant capacity in multiple sclerosis 
patients
- 63 MS patients and 83 healthy controls were given a dietary questionnaire, blood tests, quantification of cell 
membrane fatty acids, and serum antioxidant capacity to determine nutritional status.
- MS patients consumed a more limited diet compared with the healthy group, indicated by a lower average of 31 
nutrients and by consumption levels of zinc and thiamine below the recommended daily intake.
- Both consumption and measured iron values were significantly lower in MS patients, with the lowest measures in 
the severe MS group
- Long saturated fatty acids (>C16) were significantly lower in MS patients, while palmitic and palmitoleic acids 
wer both higher
- Serum total antioxidant capacity was significantly lower in the MS group compared with healthy controls, with 
the lowest measures in patients with severe MS
- This study points to the possible correlation between nutritional status and MS

Beckett et al (2019) - Diet and multiple sclerosis: scoping review of web-based recommendatiosn
- There is currently no scientific evidence supporting the use of specific diets in the management of multiple 
sclerosis (MS); the strongest dietary associations are observed with vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid 
supplementation
- The most common dietary pattern advised on these webpages was the low-fat, high-fiber balanced diet, followed 
by the low-saturated fat diet, near-vegetarian Swank diet, and the Paleo diet

Bisht et al (2014) - A multimodal intervention for patients with secondary progressive ultiple sclerosis 
feasibility and effect on fatigue
- A multimodal intervention including a modifed paleolithic diet with supplements, stretching, strengthening 
exercises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, meditation, and massage was used
- There was a significant improvement in fatigue im those who completed the study

Bisht et al (2017) - Effects of a multimodal intervention on gait and balance of subjects with progressive 
multiple sclerosis: a prospective longitudinal pilot study
- Multimodal intervention including a modified paleolithic diet, nutritional supplements, stretching, 
strenghening exervises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, meditation, and massage on 
walking performance and balance of subjects with progressive multiple sclerosis
- A multimodal lifestyle intervention may improve walking performance and balance in subjects with progressive MS 
who have mild0-to-moderate gait impairment, whereas subjects with severe gait impairments may not respond to this 
intervention

Bisht et al (2015) - Multimodal intervention improves fatigue and quality of life in subjects with progressive 
multple scerosis: a pilot study
- fatigue is a disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis and reduces quality of life
- Multimodal intervention, including a modified Paleolithic diet, nutritional supplements, stretching, 
strengthening exercises with electrical stimulation of trunk and lower limb muscles, and stress management on 
perceived fatigue and quality of life of persons with progressive MS
- subjects showed good adherence with this intervention and did not report any seriouys side effects
- High responders undertook longer duration of maassage and stretches per puscle in 12 months
- Multimodal intervention may reduce fatigue and improve quality of life of subjects with progressive MS
