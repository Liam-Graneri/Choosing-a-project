Aktas et al (2010) - Fingolimod is a potential novel therapy for multiple sclerosis
- Fingolimod is an orally available sphingosine-1-phosphate rececptor modulator that has unique and potent 
immunoregulatory properties
- Mechanistic studies indicate that on phosphorylation, fingolimod can bind with high affinity to S1P 
receptors
- Persistent modultion of lymphocyte S1P receptors by fingolimod and the subsequent internalization of 
these receptors inhibits lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes, and prevents these cells from 
infiltrating inflammatory lesions in the CNS
- Results of phase III studies - FREEDOMS and TRANSFORMS - support previous phase II trial observations 
indicating that fingolimod exerts powerful anti-inflammatory effects in relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis
- Preclinical studies suggest that fingolimod might promote neural repair in vivo

Alroughani et al (2018) - An overview of high-efficacy drugs for multiple sclerosis- Gulf Region exeprt 
opinion
- This article discusses the opinions of the multiple sclerosis experts in the Gulf region on the use of 
high-efficacy disease-modifying drugs in clinical practice
- The experts reviewed the current literature including pivotal clinical trials and meta-analysis for 
high-efficacy DMDs, supplemented by the expert opinions on the usage of these DMDs in clinical practice.
- The panel concluded that all disease-modifying drugs available for the treatment of MS have benefits and 
risks, which should be considered while discussing the treatment plan with the patient(s)

Berger et al (2015) - Severe disease reactivation in four patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis after fingolimod cessation
- Little is known about the disease course after the discontinuation of finolimod treatment
- In a case study where fingolimod had to be discontinued due to persisting lymphopenia, severe aricella 
zoster virus sinfection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and increased liver function enzymes,
- Betweeen two to four months after fingolimod cessation, these patients had a severe relapse
- Cerebral MRI found multiple new lesions, partially with contrast ring enhancement
- Partial recovery was achieved after steroid pulse therapy followed by plasma exchange in two patients
- Despite the limited evidence from this case study on potential drug reactivation exceeding pre-fingolimod 
activity in a subgroup of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients, particularly patients with high 
disease activity should undergo frequent clinical as well as radiological monitoring after fingolimod 
discontinuation

Brinkmann (2009) - FTY720 (fingolimod) in Multiple Sclerosis: therapeutic effects in the immune and the 
central nervous system
- fingolimod is a first-in-class sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that was highly effective in 
phase II clinical trials for multiple sclerosis.
- fingolimod is phosphorylated in vivo by sphingosine kinase-2 to form the active moiety FTY720-phosphate 
that binds to four of the five G protein-coupled S1P receptor subtypes
- In models of human MS and demyelinating polyneuropathies, functional antagonism of lymphocytic S1P1 slows 
S1P-driven egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, thereby reducing the numbers of autoaggressive TH17 
cells that recirculate via lymph and blood-brain barrier, and ongoing experiements suggest that the drug 
also down-modulates S1P1 in neural cells/astrocutes to reduce astrogliosis, a phenomenon associated with 
neurodegeneration in MS
- This may help restore gap-junctional communication of astrocytes with neurons and cells of the 
blood-brain barrier
- Additional effect may result from down-modulation of S1P3 in astrocytes and of S1P1 and S1P5 in 
oligodendrocytes
- fingolimod may act through immune-based and central mechanisms to reduce inflammation and support 
structural restoration of the central nervous system parenchyma

Brinkmann et al (2010) - Fingolimod (FTY720): discovery and development of an oral drug to treat Multiple 
Sclerosis
- Elucidation of the effects of fingolimod - mediated by the modulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate S1P 
receptors - has indicated that its therapeutic activity could be due to reulation of them idgraiton of 
selected lymphocyte subsets into the central nervous system and direct effects on neural cells, 
particularly astrocytes
- This article describes the discovery and development of fingolimod, which was approved byt he US Food and 
Drug administration in September 2010 as a first-line treatment for relapsing forms of MS, thereby becoming 
teh first oral disease-modifying therapy to be approved for multiple sclerosis in the United States

Chun et al (2011) - A mechanistically novel, first oral therapy for multple sclerosis: the development of 
fingolimod
- Until recently, major therapeutic treatments have relied on agents requiring injection delivery
- Fingolimod is a novel compound produced by chemical modification of a funcal precursor
- Its active metabolite, formed by in vivo phosphorylation, modulates spingosine 1-phosphate receptors that 
are a subset of a larger family of cell-surface, G protein-coupled receptors mediating the effects of 
bioactive lipids known as lysophospholipids
- Fingolimods mechanism of action in MS is not completely understood; however its relevant biology 
indicates a fundamentally different mechanism compared to all previously approved MS therapies, with 
evolving research supporting both immunological and nervous system activities

Chun & Hartung (2010) - Mechanism of action of oral fingolimod (FTY720) in Multiple Sclerosis
- There are at least five S1P receptor subtypes, known as S1P1-5, four of which bind fingolimod-phosphate. 
These receptors are expressed on a wide range of cells that are involved in many biological processes 
relevant to MS
- S1P1 plays a key role in the immune system, regulating lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues into the 
circulation
- Fingolimod-phosphate initially activates lymphocyte S1P1 via high-affinity receptor binding, yet 
subsequently reducing autoaggressive lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS
- S1P receptors are also expressed by many CNS cell types and have been shown to influence cell 
proliferation, morphology, and migration.
- Fingolimod crosses blood-brain barrier and may therefore have direct CNS effects, distinguishing it from 
immunologically targeted MS therapies

Cicalini et al (2019) - Integrated lipidomics and metabolomics analysis of tears in Multiple Sclerosis: An 
insight into diagnostic potential of lacrimal fluid
- Metabolomics based on mass spectrometry represents an innovative approach to characterise multifactorial 
diseases, such as multiple sclerosis
- To date, the most important biomarker source for MS diagnosis is the cerebro-spinal fluid
- A very interesting biofluid in MS is represented by tears, considered as an alternative fluid between the 
CSF and serum
- This paper attempts to develop a strategy for the analysis fo lipids containing choline by Liquid 
Chromatography coupled with Tandem Mass Spectrometry, as well as for the targeted analysis of free 
carnitine, acylcarnitines, and aminoacids by direct infusion mass spectrometry
- Tear lipidomics showed 30 phospholipids significantly modulated and, notable, many sphingomyelins 
resulted lower in MS
- Metabolomics approach carried out both on tears and serum highlighted the diagnostic potential of 
specific aminoacids and acylcarnitines
- The metabolic profiling of tears appears to reflect the pathological conditions of the central nervous 
system, suggesting that the molecular respository of tears can be considered as a source of potenetial 
biomarkers

Cohen et al (2010) - Oral fingolimod or intramuscular interferon for relapsing multple sclerosis
- 12 month, double-blind, double-dummy study randomised 1292 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis who had a recent history of at least one relapse to receive either oral fingolimod at a daily 
dose of either 1.25 or 0.5 mg or intramuscular interferon beta-1a
- A total of 1153 patients (89%) completed the study
- No significant differences were seen among the study groups with respect to progression of disability
- Two fatal infections occurred in the group that received the 1.25 mg dose of fingolimod: disseminated 
primary varicella zoster and herpes simplex encephalitis
- This trial showed the superior efficacy of oral fingolimod with respect to relapse rates and MRI outcomes 
in patients with multiple sclerosis, as compared with intramuscular interferon beta 1a

Goodwin (1968) - Sphingolipids and phospholipids of myelin in multiple sclerosis
- Myelin from apparently normal white matter of three cases of multiple sclerosis has been examined and a 
striking change in cerebroside sulhatide ratio demonstrated. Relative proportions of cholesterol, 
cerebrosid,e and sulphatide also show variation from the normal

Dasgupta & Ray (2017) - Diverse biological functions of sphingolipids in the CNS: ceramide and sphingosine 
regulate myelination in developing brain but stimulate demyelination during pathogenesis of multiple 
sclerosis
- Sphingolipids participate in multiple biological functions
- They particiapate in tissue development, cell recognition and adhesion, and act as receptors for toxins
- During myelination, a variety of interactive molecules such as myelin basic protein, myelin associated 
glycoprotein, phospholipids, cholesterol, sphingolipids etc. participate in a complex fasion
- This investigatoin delineated participation of several sphingolipids in myelination during rat brain 
development as well as in human brain demyelination during pathogenesis of MS
- These sphingolipids included Ceramide/dihydroceramide, sphingosine/dihydrosphingosine, and 
glucosyl/galactosylceramide; detected by column chromatography, high performance thin-layer chromatography, 
gas chromatography-mass spectometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography
- The profiles of all these sphingolipids, specifically at postnatal day, clearly indicate their importance 
during rat brain development but somewhat unspecified roles in myelination
- While ceramide has been reported to involve in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and 
Parkinson's diseaes, Sphingosine being a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C has recently been implicated 
in CNS demyelination due to MS
- Inflammatory cytokines stimulate Sphingosine eleveation in MS brains and lead to demyelination due to 
oligodendrocyte death as explained in this study by using huan oligodendroglioma culture
- In conclusion, sphingolipids are essential for brain development but they have deleterious effects in 
demyelinating diseases such as MS

Fewster et al (1976) - Lipid composition of myelin in Multiple Sclerosis
- Myeline was isolated from histologically normal white matter and plaques from MS patients and from white 
matter of neutologically normal controls
- No difference wsas found in the total lipid content
- There were no detectable deficits in MS myelin of phosphoglycerides, plasmalogens, or sphingolipids
- Gangliosides and lysolecithin were not detected
- Analysis of the fatty aldehyde composition of the phosphoglycerides and the fatty acid composition of the 
cholesterol esters, phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids did not show any differences between the normal and 
MS myelin

Goves et al (2013) - Fingolimod: direct CNS effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulation 
and implications in multiple sclerosis therapy
- The mechanism of action of fingolimod in MS has primarily been considered as immunomodulatory, wehereby 
fingolimod-P modulates S1P1 on lymphocytes, selectively retaining autoractive lymphocytes in lymph nodes to 
reduce damaging infiltration into the central nervous system
- In the MS animal model of experimental autoimmune ecephalomyelitis, fingolimod is highly efficacious in 
both a prophylactic and therapeutic setting, yet becomes ineffective in animals selectively deficient for 
S1P1 on astrocytes, despite maintained normal immunologic receptor expression and functions, and 
S1P-mediated immune activities

Halmer et al (2014) - Sphingolipids: important players in multiple sclerosis
- Current pathophysiological understanding has identified an autoaggressive immune reaction with 
infiltration of immune cells into the central nervous system and local inflammatory and demyelinating 
reactions
- Sphyngolipids, main components of nervous tissue, have been linked to MS already 60 years ago with the 
description of an unusual myelin lipid distribution in diseased patients
- Antibodies against sphingomyelin, sulfatide, or galacosylceramide have been detected in serum or CSF of 
MS patients, although up to now, this knowledge did not find its way into clinical use
- Ceramide and the enzymes linked to its production have been described to play a pivotal role in 
oligodendrocyte damage and demyelination
- There is accumulating evidence which suggests especially S1P receptors on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes 
are involved in demyelination processes and subsequent axonal degeneration, important features of chronic 
progressive MS disease course

Hatcher et al (2016) - Rebound syndrome in patients with Multiple Sclerosis after cessation of fingolimod 
treatment
- The appropriate sequencing of agents with strong immune system effects has become increasingly important
- Despite varying prior severity of relapsing-remitting course, all participants experienced unexpectedly 
severe clinical relapses accompanied by drastic increases in new or enhancnig lesions seen on magnetic 
resonance imaging

Haughey (2010) - Sphingolipids in neurodegeneration
- Although the brain contains a high content of sphingolipids, we know relatively little about the roles 
that sphingolipids play in regulating neural functions
- Recent technological and scientific advances are rapidly increasing our knowledge of the roles that 
sphingolipids play in regulating normal neural activity
- We are beginning to understand how pertubations in sphingolipid metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis 
of a variety of neurodegenerative conditions

Husted & Dhondup (2009) - Tibetal medical interpretation of myelin lipids and multiple sclerosis
- Tibetan medicine integrates diet, lifestyle, herbs, and accessory therapies to incrase health and 
longevity
- A comparison of the three humur theory of Tibetan medicine and the three thermodynamic phase properties 
of myelin lipids exemplifies how integraing medical systems can increase understanding of complex chronic 
disabling conditions
- The three classes of myelin lipids - phospholipids, sphingolipids, and cholesterol - are interpreted as 
one of three humors based on Langmuir isotherm thermodynamic measurements
- The rest of this abstract seemed bullshit so i did not continue reading

Jana & Pahan (2010) - Sphingolipids in Multiple Sclerosis
- Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system are target cells in MS
- Although the etiology of MS is poorly known, new insights suggests oligodendrocyte apoptosis as one of 
the critical events followed by glial activation and infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages
- A major breakthrough in delineation of the mechanism of cell death, perivascular cuffing and glial 
activation came from elucidation of the sphingolipid signal transduction pathway
- The sphingolipid signal transduction pathway induces apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation, and 
growth arrest depending upon cell and receptor types, and downstream targets
- Sphingomyelin, a major component of myelin membrane formed by mature oligodendrovyte, is abundant in the 
CNS and ceramide, its primary catabolic product released by activation of either neutral or acidic 
sphingomyelinase, serves as a potential lipid second messenger or mediator molecule modulating diverse 
cellular signalling pathways
Similarly, under certain conditions, sphingosine produced from ceramide by ceramidase is phosphorylated by 
sphingosine kinases to sphingosine-1-phosphate, another potent second messenger molecule
- Both ceramide and sphingosine-1 phosphate regulat life and death of many cell types including brain cells 
and participate in pathogenic processes of MS

Kappos et al (2010) - A placebo-controlled trial of oral fingolimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis
- Oral fingolimod, a sphongosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that prevents the egress of lymphocytes 
from lymph nodes, significantly improved relapse rates and end points measured on MRI, as compared with 
either placebo or intramuscular interferon beta-1a, in phase 2 and 3 studies of MS
- Fingolimod at doses of 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg significantly reduced the risk of disability progression over 
the 24 month period
- Causes of study discontinuation and adverse events related to fingolimod included bradycardia and 
atrioventricular conduction blodck at the time of fingolimod intitiation, macular edema, elevated 
liver-enzyme levels, and mild hypertension
- As compared with placebo, both doses of oral fingolimod improved the relapse rate, the risk of disability 
progression, and end points on MRI

Kappos et al (2006) - Oral fingolimod for relapsing multiple sclerosis
- A total of 255 patients completed the core study investigating the efficacy of fingolimod
- The number of gadolinium-enhanced lesions and relapse rates remained low in the groups that received 
continuous fingolimod, and both measures decreased in patients who switched from placebo to fingolimod
- In this proof-of-concept study, fingolimod reduced the number of lesions detected on MRI and clinical 
disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis

Kobelt et al (2019) - Real-life outcome in multiple sclerosis in the Czech Republic
- This study attempts to describe changes in disability, relapse activity, and health care consumption over 
the period 2008-2015 by combining two Czech cost-of-illness studies with disease data from the MS center in 
Prague
- The number of relapses was associated with a higher ris of progression

Pelletier & Hafler (2012) - Fingolimod for Multiple Sclerosis
- A 37 year old man with multiple sclerosis was evalued for consideration of oral immunotherapy
- The diagnoses of multiple sclerosis was confirmed six years earlier by meeans of examination of 
cerebrospinal fluid, which revealed an increaesed IGG index and oligoclonal banding, and by absormal 
results on magnetic resonance imaging
- This had no help

Podbielska & Krotkiewski (2012) - Signalling and regulatory functions of boiactive sphingolipids as 
therapeutic targets in Multiple Sclerosis
- Sphingolipids are an important compontent of central nervous system myelin sheaths and affect the 
viability of brain cells (oligodendrocytes, neurons, and astrocytes) that is determined by signalling 
mediated by bioactive sphingoids (lyso-SLs).
- Recent studies indicate that two lipids, ceramide, and sphingosine l-phosphate (SIP) are particularly 
involved in many human diseases, including the autoimmune inflammatory demyelination of multiple sclerosis

Strader et al (2019) - Fingolimod (FTY720): A recently approved multiple sclerosis drug based on a fungal 
secondary metabolite
- Fingolimod is a synthetic compound based on the fungal secondary metabolite myriocin
- It is a potent immunosuppressant that was approved by the US FDA as a new treatment for multiple 
sclerosis
- Fingolimod becomes active in vivo following phosphorylation by sphindosin kinase 2 to form 
fingolimor-phosphate, which binds to extracellular G protein-coupled receptors, sphingosine l-phosphates, 
and prevents the release of lymphocytes from lymphoid tissue
- Fingolimod is orally active, which is unique among the current first-line MS therapies, and has the 
potential to be used in the treatment of organ transplants and cancer

Suzuki et al (1972) - Myelin in Multiple Sclerosis
- Myelin was isolated from whte matter of five normal control brains and from normal-appearing whte matter 
of five patients with multiple sclerosis
- There was statistically significant reduction of 25% to 30% in yield of myelin from abnormal brains, due 
probably to inadvertent inclusion of small lesions
- No abnormalities were found in the distribution of major constituents
- Analysis of individual lipids, and fatty acid composition of sphingolipds did not show any differences 
between control and multiple sclerosis myelin
- Myelin isolated from normal-appearing whte matter of multiple sclerosis brains contained normal amounts 
of myelin basic protein
- chemical composition of the myelin sheath in normal-appearing white matter of mutiple sclerosis patients 
is therefore completely normal

Walter & Fabender (2010) - Sphingolipids in multiple sclerosis
- Current therapeutic approaches focus on the suppression of the immune system and on blockade of T cell 
blood-brain barrier transmigration into the brain parenchyma
- Recently, sphingolipids that have been linked to MS pathophysiology i.e. sphingosine-1-phosphate, 
intracellularly produced lysophospholipids, can be recognized by receptors located on T and B cells

Wheeler et al (2008) - A defect of sphingolipid metabolism modifies the properties of normal appearing 
white matter in multiple sclerosis
- Maintaining the appropriate complement and content of lipids in cellular membranes is critical for 
normal neural function. Accumulating evidence suggests that even subtle perturbations in the lipid content 
of neurons and myelin can disrupt their function and may contribute to myelin and axonal degradation
- This study determined the composition and quantified the content of lipids and sterols in normal 
appearing white matter and normal appearing grey matter from conrtol and multiple sclerosis brain tissues 
by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
- This study found that in active-multiple sclerosis, there is a shift in the lipid composition of both 
normal appearing white and grey matter to a higher phospholipid and lower sphingolipid content
- It was noticed that disturbance in lipid composition was reduced in normal appearing grey matter but not 
in normal appearing white matter of inactive-multiple sclerosis
- The pattern of disturbance in lipid composition suggests a metabolic defect that causes sphingolipids to 
be shuttled to phospholipid production

Zhang et al (2019) - Lipid-related genetic polymorphisms significantly modulate association between lipids 
and dsiability progression in multiple sclerosis
- Aimed to investigate whether lipid-related or body mass index-related common genetic polymorphisms 
modulate the associations between serum lipid levels, BMI and disability progression in multiple sclerosis
- Both lipid levels and lipid-related polymorphisms individually and jointly were associated with 
significantly increased disability progression in MS.
- The results indicate that these polymorphisms and tagged genes might be potential points of intervention 
to moderate disability progression

Ziemssen et al (2019) - Real-world persistence and benefit-risk profile of fingolimot over 36 months in 
Germany
- At baseline, 94.7% of patients in the effectiveness analysis had received a previous disease-modifying 
therapy
- After 36 months, 70.4% of patients were still receiving fingolimod. OVer this period, annualized relapse 
rates decreased to 0.265 from 1.79
- In total, 16% of patients had 6-month confirmed disability improvement, 12.5% had 6-month disability 
worsening, and 52.5% were free from relapses and 6-month confirmed disablity worsening
