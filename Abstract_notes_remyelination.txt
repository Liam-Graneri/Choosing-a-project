*Sclerosis and Remyelination*


Abassi-Kangevari et al (2019) - Potential therapeutic features of human amniotic mesenchymal stem 
cells in multiple sclerosis: immunomodulation, inflammation, suppression, angiogenesis, promotion, 
oxidative stress inhibition, neurogenesis induction, MMPs regulation, and remyelination 
stimulation
- MS is accompanied by demyelination of the nerves during immunological processes in the presence 
of oxidative stress, hypoxia, cerebral hypo-perfusion, and dysregulation in matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs)
- Human amniotic mesenchumal stem cells as pluripotent stem cells possess some conspicuous 
features which could be of therapeutic value in MS therapy
- hAMSCs coupld mimic the cascade of signals and secrete factors needed for promoting formation of 
stable neovascularture and angiogenesis
- hAMSCs also have immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects on inflammatory processes and 
reduce the actiity of inflammatory cells, migration of microglia and inhibit recruitment of 
certain immune cells to injury sites
- hAMSCs attenuate the oxidative stress supported by the increased level of antioxidant enzymes 
and the decreased level of lipid peroxidation products
- hAMSCs attenuate the oxidative stress supported by the increased level of antioxidant enzymes 
and the decreased level of lipd peroxidation products
- hAMSCs enhance neuroprotectino and neurogenesis in brain injuries by inhibition of inflammation 
and promotion of neurogenesis
- hAMSCs could significantly increase the expression of neurotrophic factors, which prevents 
neurons from initiating programmed cell death and improves survival, development, and function of 
neurons

Agresti et al - Oxidative status in multiple sclerosis and off-targets of antioxidants: the case 
of Edaravone
- Overproduction of reactive oxygen species by macrophages/microglia can bring about cellular 
injury and ensuring cell death by oxidizing cardinal cellular components. Oxidized molecules are 
present in active MS lesions and are associated with neurodegeneration
- The result of the three recent studies were put in the context and discussed taking into accound 
the literature on the topic
- OXidative damage underpinned an imbalance shard by MS and neurodegenerative diseases such as 
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases
- Overall, edaravone emerges as a candidate to treat complex diseases such as MS, where 
inflammation, oxidative sterss and neurodegeneration contribute to disease progressoin, together 
or individually, in different phases and disease types

Bruck et al (2003) - Remyelination in multiple sclerosis
- Remyelination depends on the presence of myelinating oligodendrocytes and a functional 
interaction between these myelinating cells and axons
- The imaging signal of remyelination in MRI or spectroscopy is not yet defined
- This review focuses on he morphological appearance of remyelinating MS lesions, their 
correlation with oligodendrocyte pathology, and possible markers for remyelination in imaging

Cui et al (2019) - Donepezil, a drug for Alzheimer's disease, promotes oligodendrocyte generation 
and remyelination
- Small molecule drugs that promote OPC to OL differentiation and remyelination may provide a new 
way to treat these demyelinating diseases
- Donepezil, an aetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease, significantly promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cells to oligodendrocyte differentiation
- Donepezil also facilitates the formation of myelin sheaths in OPC-DRG neuron co-culture
- Interestingly, Donepezil also promotes the repair of the myelin sheaths in vivo and provides 
significant therapeutic effect in a cuprizone-mediated myelination animal model

Faria Jr et al (2019) - TMEM10 promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and is expressed by 
oligodendrocytes in human remyelinating multiple sclerosis plaques
- A mammalian-specifc CNS myelin gene, tmem10, also called Opalin, encodes a type 1 transmembrane 
protein tha tis highly upregulated during early stages of OPC differentiation;m however a function 
for TMEM10 has not yet been identified
- This study detects TMEM10 protein in mouse brain imagine at ~P10 and show that protein levels 
continue to increase as oligodendrocytes differentiate and myelinate axons in vivo
- Constitutive TMEM10 overexpression in the Oli-neu oligodendroglial cell line promotes the 
expression of the myelin-associated genes MAG, CNP, and CGT whereas TMEM10 knock down in primary 
oligodndrocyte precursor cells reduces CNP mRNA expression and decreases the percentage of 
MBP-positive oligodendrocytes that differentiation in vitro
- Ectopic TMEM10 expression evokes an increase in process extension and branching, and blocking 
endogenous TMEM10 expression results in oligodendrocytes with abnormal cell morphology
- This study finds that TMEM10 promotes oligodendrocyte terminal differentiation and may represent 
a novel target to promote remyelination in demyelinating disorders

Franklin & Constant (2008) - Remyelination in the CNS: from biology to therapy
- Remyelination is mediated by a population of precursor cells called oligodendrocyte precursor 
cells, which are widely disdtributed thoughout the adult CNS
- Despite its efficiency in experimental models and in some clinical diseases, remyelination is 
often inadequate in demyelinating diseseas such as MS, the most common demyelinating disease and a 
cause of neurological disability in young adults
- The failure of remyelination has profound consequences for the health of axons, the progressive 
and irreversible loss of which accounts for the progressive nature of these diseases

Gasperoni et al (2019) - A novel comprehensive paradigm for the etiopathogenesis of multiple 
sclerosis: therapeutic approaches and future perspectives on its treatment
- Currently, the most accredited hypothesis is that the closer to the equator the more pronounced 
is the amount of sunlight which, in turn, increases the production of vitamin D
- Cholecalciferol is indeed deficient in MS patients, but this factor does not explain by itself 
the etiopathogenesis of the disease
- The arisen hypothesis was that, increaseing the latitude, the factor that varies and can have 
the stronger effect on the human organism, is the continuous and ever-increasing diversity of the 
natural light-dark cycle
- The consequent effot of the suprachiasmatic nucleus to entrain the organism's circadian rhythm 
affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis rsulting in desynchronizing the central and 
peripheral circadian clocks and pathologizing the immunitary system
- The results underscored that people living in countries subjected to a futher circadian 
disruptive factor, as daylight saving time, have a 6.35 times higher prevalence of MS than States 
placed on their same latitude that do not observe it, thus strongly supporting the hypothesis

Gharenghani et al (2019) - Melatonin therapy modulates cerebral metabolism and enhances 
remyelination by increasing PDK4 in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis
- Melatonin, a naturally occuring hormone, has emerged as a potent neuroprotective candidate to 
reduce meylin loss and imporve MS outcomes
- Results of this study find melatonin decreases neurologial disability scores and enhanced 
remyelination, significantly increasing myelin protein levels including MBP, MOG, and MOBP
- In addition, melatonin attenuated inflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines
- Melatonin significantly increased brain concentrations of lactate, N-aetylaspartate, and 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase
- Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 mRNA and protein expression levels were also increased in 
melatonin-treateed, compared to untreated EAE mice
- Although pyruvate dehydrogease complex activity was reduced by melatonin, it caused a reduction 
in inflamatory mediators while stimulating oligodendrogenesis, suggesting that oligodendrocytes 
are forced to use an alternative pathway to synthesize fatty acids for remyelination

Hoojimans et al (2019) - Remyelination promoting therapies in multiple sclerosis animal models: a 
systematic review and meta-analysis
- Many 'myelin repair' therapies have been pre-clinically tested using different models of toxic 
demyelination such as cuprizone, ethidium bromide, or lysolecithin and some of the therapies 
already entered clinical trials. However, keeping track on all these possible new therapies and 
their efficiacy has become difficult with the increasing number of studies
- This meta-analysis also identifies 16 promising therapies which did not enter a clinical dtial 
for MS so far, among them Pigment epithelium-derived factor, plateled derived growth facor, and 
tocopherol derivate TFA-12

Jia et al (2019) - Neuronal activity-dependent myelin repair after stroke
- Brain tissue undergoes substantial activity-dependent reorganisation after stroke due to 
neuronal plasticity, leading to partial functional recovery in patients
- Concurrent myelin repair is crucial for proper neuronal network function and reorganisation
- Myelin repair after stroke might occur as myelin plasticity or as remyelination through the 
recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which become myelin-forming 
olidogdendrocytes
- With ageing, the ability of OPCs to differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes decreases 
due to changes in their ion channel and neurotransmitter receptor expression profile, rendering 
them less sensitive to neuronal activity

Lassmann et al (1997) - Remyellination in multiple sclerosis
- Spontaneous remyelination is promounced in some MS patients
- The extent of remyelination correlates well with the presence of oligodendrocytes in the lesions
- The source and origin of the remyelinating cells is still unclear; they may be derived from 
either undifferentiated progenitor cells, or inpart from mature oligodendrocutes that have escaped 
destruction during lesional activity
- Complete remyelination of plaques is possible, leading tot he formation of 'shadow plaques

Ludwin (1978) - Central nervous system demyelination and remyelination in the mouse: an 
ultrastrutural stuy of cuprizone toxicity
- 6 week cuprizone model consistently showed almost complete demyelination of the superior 
cerebellar peduncle
- After formation of myelinic vacuoles and removal of myelin by macrophages and astrocytes, the 
zons became invested with astroglial processes
- As part of the glial response to demyelination, numerous reactive or immature cells apepared, 
some of which were identified as being either astrocytic or oligodendrocytic in nature
Some mature oligodendrocytes survived
- When allowed to recover on a normal diet, remyelination began within a week, and progressed 
until all axons were myelinated
- The mechanism of remyelination was similar to the spiral wrapping mechanism seen in normal 
development
- The myelinating cell in all cases was the mature oligodendrocyte
- Sources for these oligodendrocytes include residual surviving oligodendrocytes, differentiation 
of immature forms, andpossibly the perineuronal satellite cell
- The sheath eventually reached a thickness approximatly half that of normal development, with a 
disturbed relationship between myelin thickness and axon diameter
- It is concluded that the cuprizone model is an excellent situation in which to study the 
cellular mechanisms of demyelination and remyelination

Mannioui & Zalc (2019) - Conditional demyelination and remyelination in a transgenic Xenopus 
laevis
- The development of immunotherapies, by reducing the relapse rate, has profoundly impacted short 
term prognosis and patients' quality of life
- These anti-inflammatory medications, however, have not proven to be sufficient to prevent 
long-term disability progression, resulting from axonal transection and neuronal damage, 
consequences of prolonged demyelination
- Promoting remyelination is therefore a key therapeutic strategy to limit handicap progression, 
and represent the major therapeutic challenge in MS

Matsushima & Morell (2001) - The neurotoxicant, cuprizone, as a model to study demyelination and 
remyelination in teh central nervous system
- An experimental model in which massive demyelination can be reproducibly incduced in large areas 
of mouse brain is exposure to the copper chelator, curpizone, in the diet
- When 8 week old C57 mice are fed 0.2% curpizone in the diet, mature oligodendroglia are 
specifically insulated (cannot fulfill the metabolic demand of support of vast amounts of myelin) 
and go through apoptosis
- This is closely followed by recruitment of microglia and phasgocytosis of myelin
- If the cuprizone challenge is terminated, an almost complete remyelination takes place in a 
matter of weeks

Munoz-Esquivel et al (2019) - Sildenafil inhibits myelin expression and myelination of 
oligodendroglial 
precursor cells
- Phosphodiesterases have previously been implicated in oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination 
of CNS axons
- Sildenafil citrate is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor known to blod PDE5, which also reduces 
inflammation in teh experimental autoimmune encephalomyelintis demyelinating model
- This study found that sildenafil significantly diminished myelin gene expression and protein 
expression
- Moreover, sildeniafil also increased the expression of Id2 and Id4 negative transcriptional 
regulators, and the degree of oligodendoglial precursor cells with cytoplasmic p57kip2 protein 
localization was reduced, providing evvidence that PDE blocker impaired the differentiation 
capacity.

Nicaise et al (2019) - Cellular senescence in progenitor cells contributes to diminished 
remyelination potential in progressive multiple sclerosis
- Cellular senescence is a form of adaptive cellular physiology associated with aging
- The authors had previously determined that neuroal progenitor cells derived from induced 
pluripotent stem cell lines from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis failed to 
promote oligodentricyte progenitor cell maturation, whereas NPCs from age-matched control cell 
lines did so efficiently
- Expression of cellular senescence genes in PMS NPCs was found to be reversible by treatment with 
rapamycin, which then enhanced PPMS NPC support for oligodenctocyte differentiation
- Cellular senescence contributes to altered progenitor cell functions in demyelinated lesions as 
a process that contributes to remyelination failure in PMS, whic may impact how this disease is 
modeled and inform development of future myelin regenreation studies

Ortiz et al (2019) - Neuronal activity in vivo enhances functional myelin repair
- While neuronal activity stimulates oligodendrocyte production and myelination in normal 
conditions, it remains unclear whether the activity of demyelinated axons restores their 
loss-of-functino in a harmful environment
- This study established amodel to induce a moderate optogenetic stimualtion of demyelinated axons 
in the corpus callosum at the level of the motor cortex in which cortical circuit activation and 
locomotor effects were reduced in adult freely moving mice
- They demonstrated moderate activation of demyelinated axons enhances the differentiation of 
oligodendrocyte precursor cells onto mature oligodendrocyte, but only under a repeated stimulation 
paradigm
- This activity-dependent incrase in oligodendrocyte pool promotes an extensive remyelination and 
functional restoration of conduction, as revealed by ultrastructural analsys and compount action 
potential recordings

Pineas et al (1993) - Multiple sclerosis: remyelination of nascent lesions
- The raltionship between patque pathology and disease duration was examined in 15 patients with 
MS who died early in the course of their illness
- Myelin stained sections revealed that most plaques examined in patients who died during the 
first month of their illness showed evidence of ongoing myelin destruction accompaied by a loss of 
oligodendrocytes
- Plaques containing large numbers of oligodendrocytes were not observed in these patients, but 
were relatively common in patients who died more than 1 month after clinical onset
- This study provides new evidence that both oligodendrocytes and myelin are destroyed in new 
lesions, this activity ceases completely in many lesions within a few weeks, and that 
remyelination frequently ensues following repopulation of the plaque by oligodendrocytes
- The findings suggest that new lesions normally remyelinate unless interrupeted by recurrent 
activity and that remyelinated shadow plaques are the outcome of a single previous episode of 
focal demyelination

Popescu et al (2018) - Vitamin K enhances the prouction of brain sulfatides during remyelination
- The most abundant myelin lipids are galactosylceramides in their sulfated form, sulfatides, 
which together account for about 27% of the total dry weight of myelin
- This study investigated the role of vitamin K in remyelination, by using an animal model for MS, 
the cuprizone model
- Demyelination was induced in C57 mice by feeding them a diet containing 0.3% cuprizone for 6 
weeks
- After 6 weeks, the mice were allowed to remyelinate without cuprizone for either 1 or 3 weeks, 
in the absence or presence of vitamin K
- Vitamin K enhaned the production of total brain sulfatides, after both 1 and 3 weeks of 
remyelination, when compared to the control group
- Vitamin K incresed the production of individual brian sulfatides after 3 weeks of remyelination, 
when compared to the control group
- Im addition, vitamin D enhanced the production of total brain sulfatides after 3 weeks of 
remyelination, but not syndergistic effect between vitmains K and D for the production of total 
brain sulfatides was observed

Rodrigues & Lennon (1990) - Immunoglobulins promote remyelination the CNS
- Remyelination was promoted by systemic injection of serum IgG from donor mice hyperimmunized 
with homogenized spinal cord
- In SJL/J mice infected with Theiler's virus, primary demyelination and inflammation in the 
spinal cord were extensive.
- Following treatment with IgG to spinal cord homogenate, new myelin sythesis as measured by 
quantitative morphometry increased sixfold
- Cells in areas of remyelination that incorporated [3H] thymidine did not express differentiation 
markers of macrophages, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes but were idendtified by elctron 
microscopic autoradiography as progenitor glial cells
- These findings raise the posibiltiy that IgG secreted in demyalination lesions might have the 
potential to promote myelin repair

Schultz et al (2016) - Acutely damaged axons are remyelinated in multiple sclerosis and 
experimental models of demyelination
- This study employed cuprizone- and focal lysolecithin- induced demyelination and performed time 
course experiments assessing teh evolution of early and late stage remyelination and axonal damage
- This observed damaged axons with signs of remyelination after cuprizone diet cessation and 
lysolecithin injection
- To assess the correlation of remyelination and axonal damage in multiple sclerosis lesions, we 
took advantage of a cohort of patients with early and late stage remyelinated lesions and assessed 
the number of AOO and SMI32- positive damaged axons and the density of SMI31- positive and silver 
impregnated preserved axons
- Early de- and remyelinating lesions did not differe with respect to axonal density and axonal 
damage, but it was observed that lower axonal density in later stage demyelinated MS lesions than 
in remyelinated MS lesions
- This suggests that remyelination may not only be protective over a long period of time, but may 
play an important role in teh immediate axonal recuperation after a demyelinating insult

Stumpf et al (2019) - Ketogenic diet ameliorates axonal defects and promotes myelination in 
Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease
- In a model of MID with perturbed blood-brain barrier integrity, cholesterol supplementation 
promotes myelin membrain growth

Tanabe & Yamashita (2019) - Function of lymphocytes in 0ligodendrocyte development
- During brain development, oligodendrocyte precursor cells are generated in the medial ganglionic 
eminence, lateral ganglionic eminence, and dorsal pallium
- Oligodndrocyte precursor cells proliferate and migrate throughout the CNS at the embryonic stage
- After birth, OPCs differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes, which insulate axons
- Oligodendrocyte development is regulated by the extrisic environment including neurons, 
astrocytes, and immune cells
- During brain development, B lymphocytes are present in teh meningeal space, and are involved in 
oligodendrocyte develoipment during the remyelination process
- A subset of microglia contributes to oligodendrocyte development during the neonatal periods

Wang et al (2019) - Therapeutic effect of oligomeric proanthocyanidin in cuprizone-induced 
demyelination
- This study investigates the therapeutic effect of oligomeric proanthocyanidin (OPC), the most 
effective component of grape seed extract, in cuprizone-fed C57 mice
- OPC attenuated abnormal behaviour, reduced demyelination, and increased expression of myelin 
basic protein and expressoin of O4+ oligodendrocytes in teh corpus callosum
- OPC also reduced the bumber of B and T cells, activated microglia in the corpus callosum, and 
inhibited secretion of inflammatory factors
- All together, these results demonstrate a potent therapeutic effect for OPC in CPZ-mediated 
demyelinationa nd clearly highlight mutliple effects of this natural product in attenuating 
myelin-specific autoantibodies and the inflammatory microenvirnment in the brain

Yong et al (2019) - The benefits of neuroinflammation for the repair of the injured CNS
- In neuroinflammatory conditions such as MS, there is prominent infiltration and a long-lasting 
representation fo various leukocyte subsets in the CNS parenchyma
- The consequences of excessive and uncontrolled neuroinflammation are injury and death to neural 
elements, which manifest as a heterogenous set of neurological symptoms
- The recognized benefits of inflammation to the CNS include the preservation of CNS constituents, 
the proliferation and maturation of various neural precursor populations, axonal regenration, and 
the reformation of myelin on denuded axons.
- This study highlights the benefit of neuroinflammation in fostering CNS recovery after neural 
injury using examples from MS etc. This study focuses on CNS regenerative responses, such as 
neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, and remyelination, and disdcusses the mechanisms by which 
neuroinflammation is pro-regenerative for the CNS

Zhang et al (2019) - Evolution of clinical trials in multiple sclerosis
- While placebo-controlled trials for some questions may still be relevant, DMT trials in 
relapsing-remitting MS are not longer ethical
- The replacement of the placebo arm by an active comparator arm in trials have raised the cost of 
trials by requiring a larger sample size to detect on-study changes in treatment effects
- In trials for progressive forms of MS (PMS), the lack of sensitive outcome measures that can be 
sued in shorter-term trials have delayed the development of effective treatments
